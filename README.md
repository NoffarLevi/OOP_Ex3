# THE MAZE OF WAZE

This project implements a basic game using  a directional weighted graph. The goal of the game is for the Robots to catch as many Fruits as he can to reach the highest score as possible. There are 24 levels the user can pick from [0-23], each containing its own graph, number of fruit and number of robots.
Each round you choose how you want to play the game:
1. ‘Automatically’ , the Robots with move on their own while running on a set of algorithms.
2. ‘Manually’ , the user will move the Robots by a click on the Robot and then a click on the destination node, which must connected to the current node of the Robot. Each click must be as close as possible to the node.

There are three packages we carried on from the previous project

* gameClient - Contains six classes -> AlgoGame, Arena, ClientRun, Fruit, Robot, KML_Logger, MyGameGui
